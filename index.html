							<p><b>Role Played:</b> I was one of two UX designers working on the project.  We both had equal say and collaborated on each decision.</p>
							<p><b>Project Description:</b> Redesign the site to be less confusing and have a better flow.</p>
							<p><b>Different Deliverables:</b> Mood Board, Personas, Low Fidelity Wireframe, High Fidelity Wireframe, Site Map.</p>

								<p>Our mood board and low fidelity wireframe show some of the early thoughts we had for the project.  Decisions such as the pink out of stock button were scrapped because it wouldn't coincide with the users previous design understandings.</p>

								<br><br>
								<p>Our high-fidelity pages show a much better flow to the page along with eliminating confusing elements from the original site which was a main goal of ours.</p>
							<br><br>
								<p><b>Results</b></p>
								<p><b>Final Product:</b> Overall, the design ended up being something that me and my partner were proud of.</p>
								<p><b>Feedback:</b> Unfortunately, since this was a project done without the knowledge of Mint Discs, we were unable to receive feedback from the company to improve our design.</p>

								<br><br>
								<p>Our final design was an interactive html, javascript, and css page that covered the basics of the site.  This included the login, registration, and home pages.  As well as the search feature, the focused event card, and the request for help card.</p>
							<br><br>
								<p><b>Results</b></p>
								<p><b>Final Product:</b> Overall, the design ended up being something that our group was happy with.  The only thing we didn't like was that we didn't get to finish the chat page before our deadline.</p>
								<p><b>Feedback:</b> This was a fictional site so the feedback received was from classmates and professors.  Along with a couple smaller inconsequential things with the site, the big issues brought forward was the lack of color differences therefore, users with color blindness may have trouble distinguishing the different colors.</p>
